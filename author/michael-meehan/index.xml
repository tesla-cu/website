Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), on the other hand, serves as a popular tool to extract coherent structures from the fluid data and build reduced order models. We present a new method to perform POD on AMR data sets that eliminates repeated operations that arise from using nearest neighbor interpolation of the data onto a uniform grid before performing POD. More fundamentally, we believe that this is the first algorithm to eliminate redundant operations for matrix multiplications with repeated values in each matrix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We provide all code
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tesla-cu/amrPOD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a> for &lt;code>amrPOD&lt;/code> to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm as shown in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tesla-cu/amrPOD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper&lt;/a>. Specifically, we stress the algorithm using synthetically generated AMR data to identify where the new algorithm out performs standard matrix operations since the new algorithm requires additional overhead of checking the grid level at various locations. Additionally, we show with genuine AMR data of an axisymmetric buoyant jet and a compiled and optimized version of the code, our algorithm reduces the CPU time. Details of how to use the code are provided in the &lt;code>README.md&lt;/code> on

Studies of single-wake systems have shown that coherent wake vortices have a regular and predictable periodicity. A growing literature of dual-wake studies has shown that multi-wake systems are more stochastic than single-wake systems, and their dynamics are highly dependent on the spacing between the wakes. Here, we expand on this literature by investigating three-wake systems and find that the coherent dynamics of the wakes are highly intermittent. We use proper orthogonal decomposition to extract the most energetic modes of the three-wake system at six bluff-body spacings that span a range of dynamical “regimes.” After describing the time-dependent behavior of the interacting wakes in these regimes, we use a statistical approach to describe the relative phase between oscillations in each of the wakes, identifying regimes where oscillations are more or less random. Interestingly, the wake oscillations are less random when the bluff bodies are positioned very close and relatively far from each other. In between these two extremes, an intermediary regime is identified where the wake oscillations are almost completely random; this finding parallels data from the dual-wake literature. Finally, we discuss the implications of the observed behaviors and possible future directions for this work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Effect of Flame Spacing and Flow Velocity on the Dynamics of Three Interacting V-Flames</title><link>https://teslacu.org/author/effect-of-flame-spacing-and-flow-velocity-on-the-dynamics-of-three-interacting-v-flames/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/author/effect-of-flame-spacing-and-flow-velocity-on-the-dynamics-of-three-interacting-v-flames/</guid><description>&lt;p>Flame interaction is a phenomenon that occurs in a number of combustion devices and can change both the time-averaged shape and dynamical behavior of flames. In this study, we investigate the impact of flame spacing and bulk flow velocity on the time averaged characteristics of three, two-dimensional, bluff-body stabilized V-flames. Velocity fields and flame edges are extracted from particle image velocimetry (PIV) data to quantify the differences in behavior of these flames at three flame spacings and two bulk flow velocities with Reynolds numbers of 4000 and 8000 based on bluff-body diameter. Higher bulk flow velocities cause the flame intersection point to move downstream. Increasing the bluff-body spacing also moves the intersection point farther
downstream. Reducing bluff-body spacing causes the recirculation zone behind the bluff bodies to significantly diminish and reduces flame brush growth. Discussion of the impact of these geometric and flow parameters is discussed and plans for future work are provided.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>High-speed combustion</title><link>https://teslacu.org/project/turbulent_combustion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teslacu.org/project/turbulent_combustion/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since 2014, we have undertaken extensive studies of the multi-scale interactions between turbulence and premixed flames, particularly focused on highly turbulent conditions. Using a conditional Fourier analysis and data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of premixed flames, we provided the first quantitative evidence of net kinetic energy backscatter in turbulent premixed combustion. In particular, an analysis of spectral kinetic energy transfer indicated that, contrary to the net down-scale transfer of energy found in the unburnt reactants, advective processes lead to a net transfer of energy from small to large scales in the flame brush close to the products. Since this study, we have continued to examine multi-scale turbulence-flame interactions and the spectral structure of turbulence in premixed flames using structure function, differential filtering, and wavelet analyses. Taken together, these studies represent an in-depth and coordinated effort to understand the multi-scale nature of turbulence and premixed flames, and our group has subsequently become one of the leaders in this area of study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To better understand the effects of turbulence on chemical reactions in the flame, we have developed and used a Lagrangian analysis to track changes in chemical species concentrations and thermodynamic variables as they occur in fluid parcels traveling through a premixed flame. We found that temperature and chemical species evolutions along fluid trajectories were non-monotonic due to the effects of molecular transport, that fluid parcel residence times during combustion were substantially shorter as the turbulence intensity increased, and that the turbulent flame speed could be predicted using only Lagrangian information. These results have implications for our understanding of turbulent flame structure, chemical reaction pathways, flame speed predictions, and the formation of reactant pockets in highly turbulent flames. We have now extended this analysis to the study of autoignition and combustion modes in highly compressible reactive turbulence.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
