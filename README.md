# Turbulence Energy Systems Laboratory (TESLa) Website

Welcome to the source code of the  [TESLa website](https://teslacu.org) powered by the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/).

## Quickstart
Running this website locally requires `hugo` to be [installed](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install) on your machine. The website requires a minimum version so we recommend
```
brew install hugo
```
on macOS or
```
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.58.2/hugo_0.58.2_Linux-64bit.deb
dpkg -i hugo_0.58.2_Linux-64bit.deb
```
on Ubuntu since standard `sudo apt-get` installs a depreciated version.

Once `git` and `hugo` are installed: 
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:tesla-cu/website.git
$ cd website
$ hugo server
```
Open [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/) and your website should appear.
