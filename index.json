The ABC-IMCMC approach avoids the need to directly compute a likelihood function during the parameter estimation, enabling a substantial speed-up and greater flexibility as compared to full Bayesian approaches. The method also naturally provides uncertainties in parameter estimates, avoiding the artificial certainty implied by many optimization methods for determining model parameters. In this study, we outline details of the present ABC-IMCMC approach, including the use of an adaptive proposal and a calibration step to accelerate the parameter estimation process. We demonstrate the approach by estimating parameters in two nonlinear SGS closures using reference data from direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We show that the resulting parameter values give excellent agreement with reference probability density functions of the SGS stress and kinetic energy production rate in a priori tests, while also providing stable solutions in forward LES (i.e., a posteriori tests) for homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The ABC-IMCMC method is thus shown to be an effective and efficient approach for estimating unknown parameters, including their uncertainties, in SGS closure models for LES of turbulent flows.","tags":null,"title":"Parameter Estimation for Subgrid-Scale Models Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caelan Lapointe","Peter Hamlington"],"categories":null,"content":"STUFF\nSTUFF\nSTUFFFFFFF\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The ABC approach does not require the direct computation of a likelihood function, thereby enabling substantially faster estimation of unknown parameters as compared to full Bayesian analyses. The approach also naturally provides uncertainties in parameter estimates, avoiding the artificial certainty implied by optimization methods for determining unknown parameters. Details of the ABC approach are described, including the use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to accelerate the parameter estimation, and unknown model parameters are estimated based on turbulence kinetic energy reference data for four impulsively sheared homogeneous turbulence test cases, as well as periodically sheared homogeneous turbulence for five different shearing frequencies. The ABC method is shown to yield parameter values for the nonequilibrium anisotropy closure that provide good agreement between model results and the reference data.","tags":["ABC","RANS"],"title":"Turbulence Model Development Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/people/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["I.

Studies of single-wake systems have shown that coherent wake vortices have a regular and predictable periodicity. A growing literature of dual-wake studies has shown that multi-wake systems are more stochastic than single-wake systems, and their dynamics are highly dependent on the spacing between the wakes. Here, we expand on this literature by investigating three-wake systems and find that the coherent dynamics of the wakes are highly intermittent. We use proper orthogonal decomposition to extract the most energetic modes of the three-wake system at six bluff-body spacings that span a range of dynamical “regimes.” After describing the time-dependent behavior of the interacting wakes in these regimes, we use a statistical approach to describe the relative phase between oscillations in each of the wakes, identifying regimes where oscillations are more or less random. Interestingly, the wake oscillations are less random when the bluff bodies are positioned very close and relatively far from each other. In between these two extremes, an intermediary regime is identified where the wake oscillations are almost completely random; this finding parallels data from the dual-wake literature. Finally, we discuss the implications of the observed behaviors and possible future directions for this work.\n","date":1519084800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519084800,"objectID":"447c43db448577c2b42d8b52c6851b63","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/author/michael-meehan/","publishdate":"2018-02-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/michael-meehan/","section":"authors","summary":"This work explores the wake dynamics of systems with three bluff bodies with variable spacing.

Although autonomic closure has been shown in recent a priori tests to more accurately represent unclosed terms than do dynamic versions of traditional LES models, the optimization step used in the approach introduces large matrices that must be inverted, resulting in high memory usage. In order to reduce memory requirements, here we propose the use of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) in place of the optimization step, thereby yielding an autonomic closure implementation that trades memory-intensive for processor-intensive computations. These computations can be handled by co-processors such as general purpose graphical processing units that are becoming increasingly available on petascale supercomputers. In this paper, we outline the formulation of ABC-enabled autonomic closure and present initial results demonstrating the accuracy of the approach.","tags":null,"title":"Autonomic Closure for Turbulent Flows Using Approximate Bayesian Computation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Hamlington","Ryan Darragh","clarissa_briner","Colin Towery","Brian D.

Two different intensities of turbulence in the unburnt reactants are considered, giving premixed flames with Karlovitz numbers of roughly 150 and 450. These two cases are modeled using direct numerical simulations (DNS) with both multi- and single-step H$_2$–air reaction kinetics. In each of the four resulting simulations, trajectories of fluid parcels are calculated using a high-order Runge–Kutta method, and time series of temperature and chemical composition within each parcel are recorded. The resulting thermochemical trajectories are used to examine the evolution of thermodynamic quantities and chemical composition, as well as measure fluid parcel residence times and path lengths during different phases of the combustion process. Fuel mass fraction and temperature within fluid parcels are shown to be frequently non-monotonic along fluid trajectories in both single- and multi-step H$_2$–air simulations, and the prevalence of non-monotonic trajectories increases with increasing turbulence intensity. Using results from single-step simulations, it is shown that this non-monotonicity can be caused solely by molecular transport processes resulting from large gradients in temperature and species concentrations created by turbulent advection. As a related consequence of advection, fluid parcel residence times are found to be smaller than in a laminar flame and the ratio of turbulent to laminar residence times decreases from roughly 0.8 to 0.6 as the turbulence intensity increases. By contrast, fluid parcel path lengths in the present high-speed turbulent flames are found to be substantially greater than laminar path lengths, resulting in fluid parcels that travel 4 and 7 times further than in a laminar flame for the two different turbulence intensities considered here.","tags":null,"title":"Lagrangian analysis of high-speed turbulent premixed reacting flows: Thermochemical trajectories in hydrogen–air flames","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mehdi Ghoreyshi","Ryan Darragh","Sean Harrison","Andrew J.

These data sources are used to generate reduced-order aerodynamic models in the form of look-up tables that give longitudinal and lateral force and moment coefficients for different combinations of angle of attack, Mach number, side-slip angle, and canard deflection angle. Flight characteristics from CFD simulations and the vortex lattice solver are compared with wind tunnel measurements in order to determine model accuracy for both static and dynamic flight conditions. Static cases are examined at a Mach number of 0.1 for two different canard positions using an overset grid approach. Cases considered include canard deflections of $-30^{\\circ}$, $-10^{\\circ}$, $0^{\\circ}$, and $10^{\\circ}$ at angles of attack ranging from $-4^{\\circ}$ to $30^{\\circ}$ and for sideslip angles of $-6^{\\circ}$ and $6^{\\circ}$. Dynamic cases are examined for aircraft oscillations about mean angles of attack of $0^{\\circ}$ to $10^{\\circ}$, with a motion frequency of 1 Hz and an amplitude of $0.5^{\\circ}$. The results indicate that both static and dynamic aerodynamic predictions from CFD simulations are in good agreement with experiments over the range of conditions considered. The vortex lattice solver, by contrast, cannot predict vortical flows formed over the wing and canard surfaces, resulting in poorer agreement with experimental data. The CFD-based reduced order aerodynamic model is then used to investigate trim settings and handling qualities of two different canard designs. Results show that positioning the canard surface of the transonic cruiser closer to the wing requires less canard deflection and thrust force to trim the aircraft.","tags":null,"title":"Canard–wing interference effects on the flight characteristics of a transonic passenger aircraft","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Darragh","Colin Towery","Peter Hamlington","Alexei Y.

These processes are often examined using an Eule- rian framework, but recently the Lagrangian framework, a long-time tool in non-reacting flow research, has become increasingly common for the study of turbulent combustion. The two analysis frameworks are in fact equivalent, with the only difference being a change in reference frame. In this study, a Lagrangian fluid parcel tracking algorithm is developed and validated, with the ultimate goal of analyzing enstrophy (i.e., vorticity magnitude) dynamics in premixed reacting flows. The algorithm and its subroutines are applied to two-dimensional analytic flows, forced and decaying three-dimensional non-reacting homo- geneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), and a three-dimensional premixed reacting flow in an unconfined domain. The analysis of vorticity dynamics in the premixed flame case is based on data from three dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a premixed hydrogen-air flame in a doubly periodic box. Vorticity budget terms are tracked along Lagrangian trajectories as fluid parcels travel through the flame, with particular focus on understanding the evolution of turbulence through the flame preheat and reaction zones.","tags":null,"title":"Lagrangian Analysis of Vorticity Dynamics in Turbulent Premixed Flames","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Darragh","Peter Hamlington","Mehdi Ghoreyshi","Andrew J.

Therefore, the description of an elementary event, scattering of sound by an isolated vortex, can be used to predict the impact on the acoustic field of the turbulent flow.\nFor the numerical simulation of this problem, we use a linear approximation of the mathematical model. This approximation is quite realistic because it reveals the main properties of the studied phenomena. Thus we model the problem using a system of linearized Euler equations, in which a vortex is defined as a background field.\nWe use EBR (Edge-Based Reconstruction) numerical scheme, the 5th order scheme based on the quasi-one-dimensional reconstruction, implemented in highly parallel research code NOISEtte (KIAM RAS). One of the goals of this study is to test the EBR scheme\u0026rsquo;s ability to model such problems on unstructured grids and to assess its accuracy and efficiency compared to other approaches.\nFirst, we show the simulation results of the plane acoustic wave scattering by isentropic Gaussian-core vortex with a constant circulation velocity and demonstrate the grid convergence to the benchmark solution. Besides Cartesian meshes, we also use quasi-uniform unstructured triangular meshes and demonstrate that the results are almost identical for the same number of mesh points.\nWe also consider the problem of the cylindrical point source acoustic wave scattering by the Rankine vortex. We perform simulations on unstructured meshes and compare the results of different numerical approaches: a finite-volume approach (NOISEtte EBR), a finite element approach (Actran DGM), and a finite-difference (Cabaret scheme).\nThe results confirm that NOISEtte and this numerical method can be successfully used to simulate the interaction between acoustic waves and vortex structures.\n","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1362096000,"objectID":"1c75db85068cfeeec0430c95f0f0f0d2","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/author/olga-doronina/","publishdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/olga-doronina/","section":"authors","summary":"We consider a problem of linear sound scattering by an isolated vortex to investigate the interaction of the vortex flow and acoustic waves.

There are two common approaches to reduce the cost of such simulations:\n   Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), which directly resolve turbulence on large scales and use subgrid-scale (SGS) models to represent small-scale physics\n   Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches, which resolve only averaged quantities and model turbulent fluctuations\n  However, there is no universally accurate turbulence model in either of these approaches. Besides that, all models rely on empirical coefficients that we must calibrate for different flows and geometries.\nWe suggest using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods, also known as likelihood-free methods. ABC is a data-driven approach, which uses experimental or higher fidelity data to approximate the probability distribution of model parameters. As a result, we can choose model parameters and quantify their uncertainty based on (or even sample from) this estimated probability distribution.\nABC is based on the Bayesian approach but does not require knowing the analytical expression for a likelihood function. The primary advantages of ABC are its lower cost relative to full Bayesian methods and its flexibility in parameter estimation for complex models, e.g., turbulence models, which consist of partial differential equations.\nWe created a framework called TurbABC for turbulent model parameters estimation. TurbABC combines ABC with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, an adaptive proposal, and calibration steps to accelerate the parameter estimation process. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of TurbABC by estimating parameters of:\n  nonlinear SGS closures using reference data from direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence\n  nonequilibrium anisotropy RANS closure in homogeneous turbulent flow with rapidly changing strain tensor\n  RANS model parameters estimation in inhomogeneous turbulent flow (axisymmetric transonic bump)\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"fc28f3282cc10dc6ff38986b5430c903","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/project/turbulence_modeling/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/turbulence_modeling/","section":"project","summary":"Studies of turbulence physics for model development and calibration","tags":["ABC","LES","RANS","Turbulence"],"title":"Turbulent flows","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
