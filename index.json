ESMs therefore rely on modeling the small scales using Subgrid Scale Models.

A better understanding of what is happening at the SGS level will inform those seeking to improve ESMs.\nSkyler\u0026rsquo;s career has been heavily influenced by his upbringing in Alaska. Skyler graduated from the University of Alaska Anchorage in December 2016 with his Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s of Science in Mechanical Engineering. He has prior experience in both industry and research. To better understand the oil and gas industry, a major source of employment in Alaska, he interned at BP Exploration Alaska. Coming to better understand the disproportionate impact climate change will have on Alaskan communities, he sought out research opportunities related to renewable energy at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Experiments have revealed the existence of scaling relations between the Strouhal number of the puffing and the inlet Richardson number, but geometry-specific relations are required when the characteristic length is taken to be the diameter (for round inlets) or width (for planar inlets). Similar to earlier studies of rectangular buoyant jets and plumes, in the present study we use the hydraulic radius of the inlet as the characteristic length to obtain a single Strouhal–Richardson scaling relation for a variety of inlet geometries over Richardson numbers that span three orders of magnitude. In particular, we use adaptive mesh numerical simulations to compute puffing Strouhal numbers for circular, rectangular (with three different aspect ratios), triangular and annular high-temperature buoyant jets and plumes over a range of Richardson numbers. We then combine these results with prior experimental data for round, planar and rectangular buoyant jets and plumes to propose a new scaling relation that describes puffing Strouhal numbers for various inlet shapes and for hydraulic Richardson numbers spanning over four orders of magnitude. This empirically motivated scaling relation is also shown to be in good agreement with prior results from global linear stability analyses.","tags":null,"title":"Scaling of the puffing Strouhal number for buoyant jets and plumes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Torrey Hayden","Nicholas Wimer","Caelan Lapointe","Jason Christopher","Siddharth Nigam","Ani Upadhye","Mark Strobel","Peter Hamlington","Greg Rieker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"502562886b009417958a594f2dfa9d62","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/hayden-characterization-2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.522677Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hayden-characterization-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Combustion-based processing of polymer ﬁlms and other materials often requires temporal and spatial uniformity of the combustor. We characterize the temperature and H2O mole fraction of the buoyant jet above a rectangular iron-chromium catalytic combustor using diode-laser wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS). The sensor is ﬁrst validated in a tube furnace under known conditions. It is then used to characterize the temporal and spatial variation of the ﬂow exiting the combustor. The H2 O mole fraction measurements incorporate a new pathlength correction approach that uses computational ﬂuid dynamics to account for the changes in jet width. We observe 3% temporal variation of temperature over 60 s and 7% spatial variation along the length of the burner. Vertical proﬁles indicate that additional combustion is likely occurring above the catalytic surface under certain operating conditions. This type of characterization can be used for optimizing the combustor for a variety of catalytic combustion applications.","tags":null,"title":"Characterization of the Buoyant Jet above a Catalytic Combustor Using Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colin Towery","Alexei Poludnenko","Peter Hamlington"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"6e79496b8afd9823fd5875d68a6e79c0","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/towery-detonation-2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.528695Z","relpermalink":"/publication/towery-detonation-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Theory and computations have established that thermodynamic gradients created by hot spots in reactive gas mixtures can lead to spontaneous detonation initiation. However, the current laminar theory of the temperature-gradient mechanism for detonation initiation is restricted to idealized physical conﬁgurations. Thus, it only predicts conditions for the onset of detonations in quiescent gases, where an isolated hot spot is formed on a timescale shorter than the chemical and acoustic timescales of the gas. In this work, we extend the laminar temperature-gradient mechanism into a statistical model for predicting the detonability of an autoignitive gas experiencing compressible isotropic turbulence ﬂuctuations. Compressible turbulence forms non-monotonic temperature ﬁelds with tightly-spaced local minima and maxima that evolve over a range of timescales, including those much larger than chemical and acoustic timescales. We examine the utility of the adapted statistical model through direct numerical simulations of compressible isotropic turbulence in premixed hydrogen-air reactants for a range of conditions. We ﬁnd strong, but not conclusive, evidence that the model can predict the degree of detonability in an autoignitive gas due to turbulence-induced thermodynamic gradients.","tags":null,"title":"Detonation initiation by compressible turbulence thermodynamic fluctuations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julian Quick","Jennifer King","Ryan King","Peter Hamlington","Katherine Dykes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"bf7c613255a375e3c634d31ca504bf71","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/quick-wake-2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.52763Z","relpermalink":"/publication/quick-wake-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Turbines in wind power plants experience signiﬁcant power losses when wakes from upstream turbines affect the energy production of downstream turbines. A promising plant-level control strategy to reduce these losses is wake steering, where upstream turbines are yawed to direct wakes away from downstream turbines. However, there are signiﬁcant uncertainties in many aspects of the wake steering problem. For example, inﬁeld sensors do not give perfect information, and inﬂow to the plant is complex and difﬁcult to forecast with available information, even over short time periods. Here, we formulate and solve an optimization under uncertainty (OUU) problem for determining optimal plant-level wake steering strategies in the presence of independent uncertainties in the direction, speed, turbulence intensity, and shear of the incoming wind, as well as in turbine yaw positions. The OUU wake steering strategy is ﬁrst examined for a two-turbine test case to explore the impacts of different types of inﬂow uncertainties, and it is then demonstrated for a more realistic 11-turbine wind power plant. Of the sources of uncertainty considered, we ﬁnd that wake steering strategies are most sensitive to uncertainties in the wind speed and direction. When maximizing expected power production, the OUU strategy also tends to favor smaller yaw angles, which have been shown in previous work to reduce turbine loading. Ultimately, the plant-level wake steering strategy formulated using an OUU approach yields 0.48 % more expected annual energy production for the 11-turbine wind plant than a strategy that neglects uncertainty when considering stochastic inputs. Thus, not only does the present OUU strategy produce more power in realistic conditions, but it also reduces risk by prescribing strategies that call for less extreme yaw angles.","tags":null,"title":"Wake steering optimization under uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yoram Kozak","Sandeep Dammati","Luis Bravo","Peter Hamlington","Alexei Poludnenko"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"9e6f86412c2459386185aa3eebe4a014","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/kozak-weno-2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.525749Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kozak-weno-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Lagrangian particles can be used either to analyze different complex ﬂows, as massless tracers, or to model multiphase ﬂows, as particles with mass. As particles can have arbitrary positions within the computational domain, interpolation of different ﬂow quantities from the Eulerian grid is essential. Low-order centered interpolation schemes generally do not provide a suﬃcient level of accuracy for many ﬂow conﬁgurations of interest. Thus, typically, high-order centered interpolation schemes are utilized. The current study demonstrates that for highly compressible non-reacting and reacting ﬂow regimes, in which discontinuities in the ﬂow ﬁeld, e.g., shock waves arise, centered interpolation schemes tend to smear the shock and high order schemes also produce numerical oscillations. It is shown that this problem can be remedied by using WeightedEssentially-Non-Oscillatory (WENO) interpolation schemes. Extensive numerical tests are performed in order to demonstrate this, comparing the performance of WENO-3 and WENO-5 interpolation schemes with a variety of centered interpolation schemes. The ﬁrst test case involves specially designed steady state two-dimensional vortex ﬂows. For a smooth ﬂow, WENO schemes provide comparable accuracy to other high-order centered schemes. For ﬂow ﬁelds with discontinuities, WENO-3 and WENO-5 interpolation schemes can decrease the interpolation error by more than two and three orders of magnitude, respectively, in comparison with centered schemes. Solution accuracy is further studied with a normal shock wave test. It is demonstrated that centered schemes tend to smear the shock, whereas, WENO schemes capture it in a much sharper manner. Moreover, high-order centered schemes tend to oscillate in the vicinity of the discontinuity leading to nonphysical results, such as negative absolute pressure values. The same trends are retained for an unsteady three-dimensional spherical blast wave, where the shock is smeared across several grid cells, which is typical for shock-capturing ﬂow solvers. Finally, the beneﬁts of WENO schemes for the Lagrangian-particle tracking analysis of highly compressible reactive ﬂows are explored by comparing various Lagrangian particle trajectories and joint probability density functions (PDFs) for a two-dimensional cellular detonation. The results indicate that high-order centered schemes lead to unphysical results, whereas WENO schemes can provide high-order interpolation that is free of severe numerical oscillations and non-physical artifacts, which is critical for the proper analysis of the ﬂow.","tags":null,"title":"WENO interpolation for Lagrangian particles in highly compressible flow regimes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Meehan","Sam Simons-Wellin","Peter Hamlington"],"categories":null,"content":"Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) plays a fundamental role in simulating particular flow phenomena that have vastly different resolution requirements throughout the computational domain.

More fundamentally, we believe that this is the first algorithm to eliminate redundant operations for matrix multiplications with repeated values in each matrix.\nWe provide all code here for amrPOD to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm as shown in the paper. Specifically, we stress the algorithm using synthetically generated AMR data to identify where the new algorithm out performs standard matrix operations since the new algorithm requires additional overhead of checking the grid level at various locations.

Three skeletal models are produced as a result of this process, corresponding to a larger 71 species, 1,179 reaction model with 1% error in ignition delay time compared to the detailed model, an intermediate 54 species, 637 reaction model with 24% error, and a smaller 54 species, 204 reaction model with 80% error. Using the skeletal models, peak temperature, volumetric heat release rate, premixed laminar ﬂame speed, and diffusion ﬂame extinction temperatures are compared with the detailed model, revealing an average maximum error in these metrics across all conditions considered of less than 1% for the larger skeletal model, 10% for the intermediate model, and 24% for the smaller model. All three skeletal models are thus sufﬁciently accurate and computationally efﬁcient for implementation in high-resolution wildland ﬁre simulations, where other model errors and parametric uncertainties are likely to be greater than the errors introduced by the reduced kinetic models presented here.","tags":null,"title":"Reduced Gas-Phase Kinetic Models for Burning of Douglas Fir","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

These processes are strongly influenced by flame properties such as temperature and the concentration of key combustion radicals (e.g., OH). In this work, we perform in-situ laser absorption measurements of line-of-sight averaged temperature, H2O and OH for an industrial premixed ribbon burner interacting with a chilled-roller polymer-treatment system. Measurements in the unobstructed flame exhibit profiles typical of premixed flames. The addition of a chilled roller above the flame significantly alters the temperature of the flame throughout its vertical profile and shifts the location of the maximum OH concentration above the burner. Measurements at the surface of the polymer, together with post analysis of the surface oxidation, directly verify previous numerical modeling results and surface characterization studies that suggested that the hydroxyl radical in the flame (OH) is critical to surface oxidation. This study may enable future active control of premixed burner systems to maintain desired wettability and adhesion properties of polymer films. © 2018 The Combustion Institute.

The conditioning is based on local instantaneous temperatures in the premixed flame, and structure function scaling and collapse are examined using Kolmogorov-type dimensional arguments and scaling relations. Both longitudinal and lateral structure functions are computed using the local flame normal and tangent as reference directions. The analysis is based on data from direct numerical simulations of unconfined statistically-planar flames at three different intensities of turbulence in the premixed reactants. The analysis shows that as the turbulence intensity increases and for locations near the unburnt reactants, conditional structure functions approach the rN/3 inertial range scaling predicted by Kolmogorov, where N is the structure function order. Using conditionally-calculated scaling variables, it is further shown that structure functions throughout the flame increasingly collapse as the turbulence intensity increases, with a more complete collapse observed for longitudinal structure functions and for small r within the analytic (or dissipative) range. These results suggest that, at sufficiently high intensities, Kolmogorov-type scaling laws and dimensional arguments may retain some validity in premixed flames, provided that scaling variables are computed on a conditional basis for different temperatures.","tags":null,"title":"Scaling and collapse of conditional velocity structure functions in turbulent premixed flames","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I.

Four strengths of Langmuir turbulence are examined with three types of carbonate chemistry: time-dependent chemistry, instantaneous equilibrium chemistry, and no reactions. The time-dependent model is obtained by reducing a detailed eight-species chemical mechanism using computational singular perturbation analysis, resulting in a quasi steady state approximation for hydrogen ion (H+); that is, ﬁxed pH. The reduced mechanism is then integrated in two half-time steps before and after the advection solve using a Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev scheme that is robust for stiﬀ systems of diﬀerential equations. The simulations show that as the strength of Langmuir turbulence increases, CO2 ﬂuxes are enhanced by rapid overturning of the near-surface layer, which rivals the removal rate of CO2 by time-dependent reactions. Equilibrium chemistry and nonreactive models are found to bring more and less carbon, respectively, into the ocean as compared to the more realistic time-dependent model. These results have implications for Earth system models that either neglect Langmuir turbulence or use equilibrium, instead of time-dependent, chemical mechanisms.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of Langmuir Turbulence on Upper Ocean Carbonate Chemistry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason Christopher","Nicholas Wimer","Caelan Lapointe","Torrey R.

A formulation is developed that addresses the compressible spectral dynamics of the kinetic energy in wavelet space. The wavelet basis enables the examination of local energy spectra, along with inter-scale and subﬁlter-scale (SFS) cumulative energy ﬂuxes across a scale cutoff, all quantities being available either unconditioned or conditioned on the local instantaneous value of the progress variable across the ﬂame brush. The results include the quantiﬁcation of mean spectral values and associated spatial variabilities. The energy spectra undergo, in most locations in the ﬂame brush, a precipitous drop that starts at scales of the same order as the characteristic ﬂame scale and continues to smaller scales, even though the corresponding decrease of the mean spectra is much more gradual. The mean convective inter-scale ﬂux indicates that convection increases the energy of small scales, although it does so in a non-conservative manner due to the high aspect ratio of the grid, which limits the maximum scale level that can be used in the wavelet transform, and to the non-periodic boundary conditions, which exchange energy through surface forces, as explicitly elucidated by the formulation. The mean pressure-gradient inter-scale ﬂux extracts energy from intermediate scales of the same order as the characteristic ﬂame scale, and injects energy in the smaller and larger scales. The local SFS-cumulative contribution of the convective and pressure-gradient mechanisms of energy transfer across a given cutoff scale imposed by a wavelet ﬁlter is analysed. The local SFS-cumulative energy ﬂux is such that the subﬁlter scales upstream from the ﬂame always receive energy on average. Conversely, within the ﬂame brush, energy is drained on average from the subﬁlter scales by convective and pressure-gradient effects most intensely when the ﬁlter cutoff is larger than the characteristic ﬂame scale.","tags":null,"title":"Spatially localized multi-scale energy transfer in turbulent premixed combustion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["michael_meehan","Ankit Tyagi","Jacqueline O'Connor"],"categories":null,"content":"This work explores the wake dynamics of systems with three bluff bodies with variable spacing.

Here, we expand on this literature by investigating three-wake systems and find that the coherent dynamics of the wakes are highly intermittent. We use proper orthogonal decomposition to extract the most energetic modes of the three-wake system at six bluff-body spacings that span a range of dynamical “regimes.” After describing the time-dependent behavior of the interacting wakes in these regimes, we use a statistical approach to describe the relative phase between oscillations in each of the wakes, identifying regimes where oscillations are more or less random. Interestingly, the wake oscillations are less random when the bluff bodies are positioned very close and relatively far from each other. In between these two extremes, an intermediary regime is identified where the wake oscillations are almost completely random; this finding parallels data from the dual-wake literature.

Two different intensities of turbulence in the unburnt reactants are considered, giving premixed ﬂames with Karlovitz numbers of roughly 150 and 450. These two cases are modeled using direct numerical simulations (DNS) with both multi- and single-step H2–air reaction kinetics. In each of the four resulting simulations, trajectories of ﬂuid parcels are calculated using a high-order Runge–Kutta method, and time series of temperature and chemical composition within each parcel are recorded. The resulting thermochemical trajectories are used to examine the evolution of thermodynamic quantities and chemical composition, as well as measure ﬂuid parcel residence times and path lengths during different phases of the combustion process. Fuel mass fraction and temperature within ﬂuid parcels are shown to be frequently non-monotonic along ﬂuid trajectories in both single- and multi-step H2–air simulations, and the prevalence of non-monotonic trajectories increases with increasing turbulence intensity. Using results from single-step simulations, it is shown that this non-monotonicity can be caused solely by molecular transport processes resulting from large gradients in temperature and species concentrations created by turbulent advection. As a related consequence of advection, ﬂuid parcel residence times are found to be smaller than in a laminar ﬂame and the ratio of turbulent to laminar residence times decreases from roughly 0.8 to 0.6 as the turbulence intensity increases. By contrast, ﬂuid parcel path lengths in the present high-speed turbulent ﬂames are found to be substantially greater than laminar path lengths, resulting in ﬂuid parcels that travel 4 and 7 times further than in a laminar ﬂame for the two different turbulence intensities considered here.","tags":null,"title":"Lagrangian analysis of high-speed turbulent premixed reacting flows: Thermochemical trajectories in hydrogen–air flames","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mehdi Ghoreyshi","Ryan Darragh","Sean Harrison","Andrew J.

These data sources are used to generate reduced-order aerodynamic models in the form of look-up tables that give longitudinal and lateral force and moment coeﬃcients for different combinations of angle of attack, Mach number, side-slip angle, and canard deﬂection angle. Flight characteristics from CFD simulations and the vortex lattice solver are compared with wind tunnel measurements in order to determine model accuracy for both static and dynamic ﬂight conditions. Static cases are examined at a Mach number of 0.1 for two different canard positions using an overset grid approach. Cases considered include canard deﬂections of −30◦, −10◦, 0◦, and 10◦ at angles of attack ranging from −4◦ to 30◦ and for sideslip angles of −6◦ and 6◦. Dynamic cases are examined for aircraft oscillations about mean angles of attack of 0◦ to 10◦, with a motion frequency of 1 Hz and an amplitude of 0.5◦. The results indicate that both static and dynamic aerodynamic predictions from CFD simulations are in good agreement with experiments over the range of conditions considered. The vortex lattice solver, by contrast, cannot predict vortical ﬂows formed over the wing and canard surfaces, resulting in poorer agreement with experimental data. The CFD-based reduced order aerodynamic model is then used to investigate trim settings and handling qualities of two different canard designs. Results show that positioning the canard surface of the transonic cruiser closer to the wing requires less canard deﬂection and thrust force to trim the aircraft.","tags":null,"title":"Canard–wing interference effects on the flight characteristics of a transonic passenger aircraft","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colin Towery","Olga Doronina","Peter Hamlington"],"categories":null,"content":"SpectralLES is a pure-Python pseudospectral large eddy simulation solver for educational instruction and model development based upon the spectralDNS3D_short CFD simulation code written by Mikael Mortensen.\n","date":1503964800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503964800,"objectID":"0bfccc43618c55cb9fc40b71da371934","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/software/spectralles/","publishdate":"2017-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/spectralles/","section":"software","summary":"Pure-Python pseudospectral large eddy simulation solver for model testing and development","tags":null,"title":"spectralLES","type":"software"},{"authors":["Shelby Mason","Peter Hamlington","Benjamin Hamlington","W.

Using acetone as the working fluid, the heat strap has an average effective thermal conductivity of 2149 W/m K, which is approximately five times greater than the thermal conductivity of pure copper. Moreover, the heat strap has a total thickness of only 0.86 mm and is able to withstand internal vapor pressures as high as 930 kPa, demonstrating the suitability of the heat strap for orbital environments where pressure differences can be large. A reduced-order, closed-form theoretical model has been developed in order to predict the maximum heat load achieved by the heat strap for different design and operating parameters.

Moreover, compared to the common approach of superimposing prescribed wake deﬁcits onto linearized ﬂow models, the computational efﬁciency of the adjoint approach allows the use of higher-ﬁdelity RANS ﬂow models which can capture nonlinear turbulent ﬂow physics within a wind plant. The steady-state RANS ﬂow model is implemented in the Python ﬁnite-element package FEniCS and the derivation and solution of the discrete adjoint equations are automated within the dolfin-adjoint framework. Gradient-based optimization of wind turbine locations is demonstrated for idealized test cases that reveal new optimization heuristics such as rotational symmetry, local speedups, and nonlinear wake curvature effects.

In order to investigate these phenomena, direct numerical simulations of a turbulent premixed flame are analyzed in this study. The results reveal a flux of kinetic energy that involves a cross-scale transfer through the turbulence cascade and whose prevailing direction in the flame brush is from subgrid to resolved scales. The root cause of this reversal in energy transfer, termed subgrid-scale (SGS) backscatter, is the effect of thermal expansion in the subgrid scales, by which small amounts of enthalpy created by combustion heat release are transformed into small-scale kinetic energy by means of the SGS pressure-gradient velocity correlation. The resulting overload of SGS kinetic energy is transferred to the resolved scales through SGS backscatter. This cross-scale flux of energy, along with a larger one that relies on large-scale quantities only and does not involve the energy cascade, describes the transformation of combustion heat release into kinetic energy in the turbulent premixed flame. Based on scaling analyses, it is theorized that the contribution of the cross-scale flux to the total kinetic-energy augmentation vanishes in combustion regimes in which the flame-transit time is too short to allow for activation of the non-linear convective mechanisms of the energy cascade.","tags":null,"title":"The cross-scale physical-space transfer of kinetic energy in turbulent premixed flames","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Torrey Hayden","Nicholas Wimer","Caelan Lapointe","Jason Christopher","Siddharth Nigam","Peter Hamlington","Greg Rieker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"dcbd3c4cc5a3b39628607a51efa6be77","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/hayden-wavelength-2017/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.550645Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hayden-wavelength-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy of OH Radical in an Industrial Flame","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sean Harrison","Ryan Darragh","Peter Hamlington","Mehdi Ghoreyshi","Andrew J.

The LES solves the wave-averaged, or Craik-Leibovich, equations in order to account for the Stokes forces that result from interactions between nonbreaking surface waves and currents, and resolves both submesoscale eddies and boundary layer turbulence down to 4.9 m 3 4.9 m 3 1.25 m grid scales. It is found that submesoscale frontogenesis differs from traditional frontogenesis theory due to four effects: Stokes forces, momentum and kinetic energy transfer from submesoscale eddies to frontal secondary circulations, resolved turbulent stresses, and unbalanced torque. In the energy, momentum, angular momentum, and vorticity budgets for the frontal overturning circulation, the Stokes shear force is a leading-order contributor, typically either the second or third largest source of frontal overturning. These effects violate hydrostatic and thermal wind balances during submesoscale frontogenesis. The effect of the Stokes shear force becomes stronger with increasing alignment of the front and Stokes shear and with a nondimensional scaling. The Stokes shear force and momentum transfer from submesoscale eddies signiﬁcantly energize the frontal secondary circulation along with the buoyancy.","tags":null,"title":"Surface waves affect frontogenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.

The autonomic approach expresses the local SGS stress tensor as the most general unknown nonlinear function of the resolvedscale primitive variables at all locations and times using a Volterra series. This series is analogous to a Taylor series expansion in both time and space, and incorporates nonlinear, nonlocal, and nonequilibrium turbulence effects. The series introduces a large number of convolution kernel coefﬁcients that are found by solving an inverse problem to minimize the error in representing known subgrid-scale stresses at a test ﬁlter scale. The optimized coefﬁcients are then projected to the LES scale by invoking scale similarity in the inertial range and applying appropriate renormalizations. This new closure approach avoids the need to specify a turbulent constitutive model and instead identiﬁes an optimal model on the ﬂy. Here we present the most general formulation of the new autonomic approach and outline an inverse modeling method for optimizing the coefﬁcients. We then explore truncations of the series expansion and demonstrate the effects of regularization and sampling on the optimal coefﬁcients. Finally, we perform a priori tests of this approach using data from direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic and sheared turbulence. We ﬁnd substantial improvements over the Dynamic Smagorinsky model, even for a 2nd order time-local truncation of the present closure.","tags":null,"title":"A new autonomic closure for large eddy simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan King","Peter Hamlington","Katherine Dykes","Peter Graf"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"0ea94cc60870165438c35c69294da914","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/king-adjoint-2016/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.544591Z","relpermalink":"/publication/king-adjoint-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Adjoint Optimization of wind Farm Layouts for Systems Engineering Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Torrey Hayden","Caelan Lapointe","Nicholas Wimer","Jason Christopher","Peter Hamlington","Greg Rieker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"11aee0ffe8efbdf329119ca29de1d25b","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/hayden-characterization-nodate/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.551411Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hayden-characterization-nodate/","section":"publication","summary":"An understanding of the spatial and temporal variation of a non-uniform combustion environment can aid in the optimization of industrial and power production processes. Absorption spectroscopy is often used to quantify temperature and species mole fraction, but is limited to line-of-sight measurements. Without an understanding of the non-uniform flow-field, it is difficult to interpret species mole fraction quantities using standard absorption spectroscopy approaches. We demonstrate a new approach to characterize the species mole fraction by using computational fluid dynamics models to inform the data interpretation through a pathlength weighting function. The technique is demonstrated in a heated buoyant jet above a catalytic combustor, by performing a fine vertical scan and 2D scan of the combustor. The results suggest the path length correction can have a significant impact on the measured values, which may lead to new conclusions.","tags":null,"title":"Characterization of a Jet Above a Catalytic Combustor Using Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colin Towery","Alexei Poludnenko","Peter Hamlington"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"53bb69acaed660de5d078c21c0b24275","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/towery-direct-nodate/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.554869Z","relpermalink":"/publication/towery-direct-nodate/","section":"publication","summary":"The autoignition of reactants is a fundamental aspect of the reliability and sustainability of high-speed combustion systems, such as in scramjet engines.

There can be substantial heterogeneity in the spatial distributions of these tracers due to turbulent stirring, particularly in the submesoscale range where partly geostrophic fronts and eddies and small-scale three-dimensional turbulence are simultaneously active. In this study, a large eddy simulation spanning horizontal scales from 20 km down to 5 m is used to examine the effects of multiscale turbulent mixing on nonreactive passive ocean tracers from interior and sea-surface sources. The simulation includes the effects of both wave-driven Langmuir turbulence and submesoscale eddies, and tracers with different initial and boundary conditions are examined in order to understand the respective impacts of small-scale and submesoscale motions on tracer transport. Tracer properties are characterized using spatial ﬁelds and statistics, multiscale ﬂuxes, and spectra, and the results detail how tracer mixing depends on air-sea tracer ﬂux rate, tracer release depth, and ﬂow regime. Although vertical ﬂuxes of buoyancy by submesoscale eddies compete with mixing by Langmuir turbulence, vertical ﬂuxes of tracers are often dominated by Langmuir turbulence, particularly for tracers that are released near the mixed-layer base or that dissolve rapidly through the surface, even in regions with pronounced submesoscale activity. Early in the evolution of some tracers, negative eddy diffusivities occur co-located with regions of negative potential vorticity, suggesting that symmetric instabilities or other submesoscale phenomenon may act to oppose turbulent mixing.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of submesoscale turbulence on ocean tracers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Hamlington","Ryan Darragh","Alexei Poludnenko"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"c0799bc92763cff317de2e34d3529be1","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/hamlington-effects-nodate/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.548905Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hamlington-effects-nodate/","section":"publication","summary":"A Lagrangian analysis approach is used to track changes in reactant mass fraction and temperature within ﬂuid parcels during premixed combustion.

Both of the turbulence intensities are high, with Karlovtiz and Damköhler numbers corresponding a broadened ﬂame. By analyzing time series of reactant mass fraction and temperature along ﬂuid parcel trajectories, we show that fuel consumption and temperature rise within ﬂuid parcels are frequently non-monotonic, resulting in frequent cooling events even after the temperature within a parcel has risen to 1400 K or more. Through an analysis of dynamical effects in the governing equation for the reactant mass fraction, this non-monotonicity is shown to be due to strong molecular diffusive processes resulting from the creation of large thermochemical gradients by turbulent advection.

The simulations show that waves and tidal velocity have the largest impacts on the strength of bending moments, while boundary layer stability and wind speeds have only minimal impacts.

Data from an acoustic Doppler velocimeter in Puget Sound, WA are used to perform a detailed characterization of the turbulent ﬂow encountered by a turbine in a tidal strait. Metrics such as turbulence intensity, structure functions, probability density functions, intermittency, coherent turbulence kinetic energy, anisotropy invariants, and a new scalar measure of anisotropy are used to characterize the turbulence. The results indicate that the scalar anisotropy magnitude can be used to identify and parameterize coherent, turbulent events in the ﬂow. An analysis of the anisotropy characteristics leads to a physical description of turbulent stresses as being primarily one- or two-dimensional, in contrast to isotropic, three-dimensional turbulence. A new measure of the anisotropy magnitude is introduced to quantify the level of anisotropic, coherent turbulence in a coordinate-independent way. These diagnostics and results will be useful for improved realism in modeling the performance and loading of turbines in realistic ocean environments.","tags":null,"title":"Characterization of turbulence anisotropy, coherence, and intermittency at a prospective tidal energy site: Observational data analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan King","Peter Hamlington","Werner Dahm"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"e4a1e38fed952f254eda987a07aec925","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/king-autonomic-2015/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.539618Z","relpermalink":"/publication/king-autonomic-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Autonomic Subgrid-Scale Closure for Large Eddy Simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Hamlington","Peter Hamlington","Sean Collins","Spencer Alexander","K.-Y.

A simulation without Stokes drift forcing is also performed for comparison. Spatial and spectral properties of temperature, velocity, and vorticity ﬁelds are described, and these ﬁelds are scale decomposed in order to examine multiscale ﬂuxes of momentum and buoyancy. Buoyancy ﬂux results indicate that Langmuir turbulence counters the restratifying effects of submesoscale eddies, leading to small-scale vertical transport and mixing that is 4 times greater than in the simulations without Stokes drift forcing. The observed ﬂuxes are also shown to be in good agreement with results from an asymptotic analysis of the surface-wave-averaged, or Craik–Leibovich, equations. Regions of potential instability in the ﬂow are identiﬁed using Richardson and Rossby numbers, and it is found that mixed gravitational/symmetric instabilities are nearly twice as prevalent when Langmuir turbulence is present, in contrast to simulations without Stokes drift forcing, which are dominated by symmetric instabilities. Mixed layer depth calculations based on potential vorticity and temperature show that the mixed layer is up to 2 times deeper in the presence of Langmuir turbulence. Differences between measures of the mixed layer depth based on potential vorticity and temperature are smaller in the simulations with Stokes drift forcing, indicating a reduced incidence of symmetric instabilities in the presence of Langmuir turbulence.","tags":null,"title":"Langmuir–Submesoscale Interactions: Descriptive Analysis of Multiscale Frontal Spindown Simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Hamlington","Matthias Ihme"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1404172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404172800,"objectID":"d4d070f377adbcdc85fbbabd5dcb56b0","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/hamlington-modeling-2014/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.510517Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hamlington-modeling-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"The response of homogeneous turbulence to rapid mean-flow compression in idealized internal combustion engines and rapid compression machines is examined using a hierarchy of closure models for the Reynolds stress anisotropy. This hierarchy is based on a Reynolds stress anisotropy transport equation that is modeled from the exact transport equation for the anisotropy. The hierarchy of models includes a recentlydeveloped non-equilibrium model, which is shown to be in good agreement with more computationally-complex fully differential models. Using this hierarchical approach, the flow physics addressed by each closure is identified and closure accuracy is shown to depend on the degree to which non-equilibrium turbulent flow effects are captured. We examine the evolution of the turbulence kinetic energy, Reynolds stresses, and anisotropy as a function of the degree of non-equilibrium in the flow, which is parameterized by the ratio of characteristic turbulence and mean-flow deformation time scales. By comparing model results to results obtained from rapid distortion theory and higher level closures, prescriptions are provided for the applicability of different closure models based on the magnitude of the non-equilibrium parameter. The theoretical analysis is complemented by comparisons of simulation results with previously established direct numerical simulations for a one-dimensional compression. Finally, we connect these prescriptions with experimental measurements of turbulent and mean-flow time scales for internal combustion engines operating at realistic conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling of Non-Equilibrium Homogeneous Turbulence in Rapidly Compressed Flows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Spencer Alexander","Peter Hamlington"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1401580800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1401580800,"objectID":"63f9e6719b8745618442b401208723ee","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/publication/alexander-study-2014/","publishdate":"2020-06-27T15:52:06.536624Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander-study-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"As ocean current turbines move from the design stage into production and installation, a better understanding of oceanic turbulent ﬂows and localized loading is required by researchers and members of industry.

In this study, large eddy simulations (LES) are used to model the turbulent boundary layer in which an ocean current turbine operates. The LES model captures current driving due to winds, waves, and tides, thereby providing a high degree of physical realism. Inﬂow and boundary conditions are designed to represent conditions during an observational campaign at Admiralty Head in Puget Sound, and comparisons are made between the LES results and available observational measurements. Further statistical measures of the LES ﬂow ﬁelds are outlined, including vertical proﬁles of Reynolds stresses, turbine loading, and two point correlations. The ability of the synthetic turbulence generator TurbSim to reproduce realistic ocean turbulence is qualitatively assessed through comparisons with LES results.

Understanding the sound generation process is essential for many practical applications.\nWhen turbulence is represented by a distribution of localized vortices with certain static properties, the acoustic field scattered by such a flow is a superposition of scattered acoustic fields from each vortex. Therefore, the description of the elementary event of sound scattering sound by an isolated vortex can be used to predict the impact of turbulence on the acoustic field.\nFor the numerical simulation of this problem, we used a linear approximation of the mathematical model. This approximation is quite realistic because it reveals the main properties of the studied phenomena.

This problem is difﬁcult because the upper ocean is home to many competing processes. Vertical turbulent mixing acts to unstratify the water column, while lateral submesoscale eddies attempt to stratify the column. Langmuir turbulence, which often dominates the vertical mixing, is driven by an interaction of the wind stress and surface wave (Stokes) drift, while the submesoscale eddies are driven by lateral density and velocity changes. Taken together, these processes span a large range of spatial and temporal scales. They have been studied separately via theory and modeling. It has been demonstrated that the way these scales are represented in climate models has a nontrivial impact on the global climate system. The largest impact is on upper ocean processes, which ﬁlter air-sea interactions. This interaction is especially interesting, because it is the interface between nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic, quasigeostrophic and ageostrophic, and small-scale and large-scale ocean dynamics. Previous studies have resulted in parameterizations for Langmuir turbulence and submesoscale ﬂuxes, but these parameterizations assume that there is no interaction between these important processes. In this work we have utilized a large XSEDE allocation (9 million SUs) to perform multiscale simulations that encompass the Langmuir scale (O(10100m)) and submesoscale eddies (O(1-10km)).

Such fires are nearly always distinguished by wide ranges of spatiotemporal scales and physical phenomena, thus placing considerable constraints on the achievable size and complexity of simulations. We have made new progress in using a well-known technique – Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) – to overcome these limitations. With AMR, grid cells are placed only where they are needed to resolve large gradients in velocity, temperature, species, and other user-defined flow quantities. We demonstrate the use of an AMR-enabled FireFOAM solver for simulations of pool fires, and compare simulation results with experimental data and prior computational efforts. Capabilities of the new solver are outlined, with a view towards providing this tool, once completed, to the broader fire modeling community. We also highlight the potential of AMR to enable future direct numerical simulations (DNS) of fire dynamics, in particular using the multi-physics code PeleLM. Such simulations will provide some of the highest-fidelity predictions of fire dynamics to date, and will be made possible through the use of AMR to minimize the computational cost that typically accompanies DNS.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bad170ec1806bf330a91b68e79a50d59","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/project/wildland_fire/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/wildland_fire/","section":"project","summary":"High-fidelity simulations of fire in both natural and built environments","tags":["Turbulence"],"title":"Fire dynamics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Michael Meehan","Ryan Darragh","Colin Towery","Sam Whitman","Jennifer Miklaszewski","Peter Hamlington"],"categories":null,"content":"Since 2014, we have undertaken extensive studies of the multi-scale interactions between turbulence and premixed flames, particularly focused on highly turbulent conditions. Using a conditional Fourier analysis and data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of premixed flames, we provided the first quantitative evidence of net kinetic energy backscatter in turbulent premixed combustion. In particular, an analysis of spectral kinetic energy transfer indicated that, contrary to the net down-scale transfer of energy found in the unburnt reactants, advective processes lead to a net transfer of energy from small to large scales in the flame brush close to the products. Since this study, we have continued to examine multi-scale turbulence-flame interactions and the spectral structure of turbulence in premixed flames using structure function, differential filtering, and wavelet analyses. Taken together, these studies represent an in-depth and coordinated effort to understand the multi-scale nature of turbulence and premixed flames, and our group has subsequently become one of the leaders in this area of study.\nTo better understand the effects of turbulence on chemical reactions in the flame, we have developed and used a Lagrangian analysis to track changes in chemical species concentrations and thermodynamic variables as they occur in fluid parcels traveling through a premixed flame. We found that temperature and chemical species evolutions along fluid trajectories were non-monotonic due to the effects of molecular transport, that fluid parcel residence times during combustion were substantially shorter as the turbulence intensity increased, and that the turbulent flame speed could be predicted using only Lagrangian information. These results have implications for our understanding of turbulent flame structure, chemical reaction pathways, flame speed predictions, and the formation of reactant pockets in highly turbulent flames. We have now extended this analysis to the study of autoignition and combustion modes in highly compressible reactive turbulence.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"694a1dff6fe49e24ec73a562e4e6c06b","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/project/turbulent_combustion/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/turbulent_combustion/","section":"project","summary":"Physics-based studies of high-speed turbulent premixed combustion","tags":["DNS","Turbulence"],"title":"High-speed combustion","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sam Simons-Wellin","Caelan Lapointe","Peter Hamlington"],"categories":null,"content":"With Prof. Greg Rieker at CU, we have performed joint experimental and computational research on catalytic and ribbon burners used for industrial processing of polymer films on chilled rollers. On the computational side, we have developed a simulation testbed in OpenFOAM for the study of temperature, flow fields, and heat transfer processes (i.e., radiation and convection) above the burner and in the burner/roller interaction region. The simulation tool has been used to examine a wide range of conditions, including different roller speeds, burner/roller spacings, burner orientations, and power fluxes. Burners operating in isolation and as part of a larger array have also been studied. Simulations have provided 3D temperature, flow, and heat transfer fields for each of these cases, revealing several useful design heuristics, including the advantage of a down-firing burner configuration, the negative impacts of convective heat transfer on temperature uniformity, and the advantageous effects on uniformity of flow-blocking by the roller.\nApproximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a data-driven technique that uses many low-cost numerical simulations to estimate unknown physical or model parameters (e.g., boundary conditions and material properties), as well as their uncertainties, given reference data from real-world experiments or higher-fidelity numerical simulations. We have used ABC to estimate unknown parameters in simulations of complex thermal-fluid flows, and the technique has been demonstrated for the estimation of unknown boundary conditions in experiments of high temperature burners used for polymer film flame treatments. These tests show that ABC provides accurate and reasonably certain estimates of inflow parameters even when the model simulations imperfectly represent the physics underlying the reference experimental data. We also demonstrate the use of ABC to estimate unknown model parameters in large eddy simulations and Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations of turbulent flows. ABC is thus shown to be a versatile technique for estimating unknown physical and model parameters, resulting in substantial improvements in simulation accuracy.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a826494230cfb014618d840975698ebb","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/project/industrial_systems/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/industrial_systems/","section":"project","summary":"Modeling and optimization of real-world engineering and industrial systems","tags":["LES","RANS","Optimization"],"title":"Industrial systems","type":"project"},{"authors":["Skyler Kern","Mary McGuinn","Peter Hamlington"],"categories":null,"content":"Ocean tracers such as carbon dioxide, nutrients, plankton, and oil advect, diffuse, and react primarily in the oceanic mixed layer where air-sea gas exchange occurs and light is plentiful for photosynthesis. There can be substantial heterogeneity in the spatial distributions of these tracers due to turbulent stirring, particularly in the submesoscale range where partly geostrophic fronts and eddies and small-scale three-dimensional turbulence are simultaneously active. We have used LES to understand the respective impacts of small-scale and submesoscale motions on tracer transport. Tracer properties have been characterized using spatial fields and statistics, multiscale fluxes, and spectra, and we detailed how tracer mixing depends on air-sea tracer flux rate, tracer release depth, and flow regime. Although vertical fluxes of buoyancy by submesoscale eddies were shown to compete with mixing by Langmuir turbulence, vertical fluxes of tracers were often dominated by Langmuir turbulence, particularly for tracers released near the mixed-layer base or that dissolve rapidly through the surface, even in regions with pronounced submesoscale activity.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3226cf02d198debb0dd73df6aa348fa8","permalink":"https://teslacu.org/project/ocean_biogeochemistry/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ocean_biogeochemistry/","section":"project","summary":"Reduced-order modeling for high-fidelity simulations of the upper ocean","tags":["POM"],"title":"Ocean biogeochemistry","type":"project"},{"authors":["Olga Doronina","Julian Quick","Peter Hamlington"],"categories":null,"content":"Turbulence model development using Approximate Bayesian Computation Real-world turbulent flows are challenging to simulate due to the high computational cost of resolving all their relevant spatial and temporal scales. There are two common approaches to reduce the cost of such simulations:\n   Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), which directly resolve turbulence on large scales and use subgrid-scale (SGS) models to represent small-scale physics\n   Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches, which resolve only averaged quantities and model turbulent fluctuations\n  However, there is no universally accurate turbulence model in either of these approaches. Besides that, all models rely on empirical coefficients that we must calibrate for different flows and geometries.\nWe suggest using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods, also known as likelihood-free methods. ABC is a data-driven approach, which uses experimental or higher fidelity data to approximate the probability distribution of model parameters. As a result, we can choose model parameters and quantify their uncertainty based on (or even sample from) this estimated probability distribution.\nABC is based on the Bayesian approach but does not require knowing the analytical expression for a likelihood function. The primary advantages of ABC are its lower cost relative to full Bayesian methods and its flexibility in parameter estimation for complex models, e.g., turbulence models, which consist of partial differential equations.\nWe created a framework called turbABC for turbulent model parameters estimation. TurbABC combines ABC with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, an adaptive proposal, and calibration steps to accelerate the parameter estimation process.
